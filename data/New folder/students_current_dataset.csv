101,19,14,3.3,medium,87,85,high,This course exceeded my expectations in terms of content depth and practical application. The professor's use of interactive technologies and real-world case studies made complex theories much more accessible. I particularly appreciated the flipped classroom approach where we discussed readings during class time rather than just listening to lectures. The peer review sessions were incredibly valuable for improving my writing and critical thinking skills. The only downside was the occasional technical difficulties with the online platform.
102,22,7,2.9,easy,76,79,medium,"I found this course to be somewhat underwhelming compared to the course description. While the professor was knowledgeable, the delivery felt outdated and didn't incorporate modern teaching methods effectively. The assignments were straightforward but lacked creativity and didn't challenge me to think beyond basic comprehension. I was hoping for more interactive discussions and contemporary examples that relate to current industry trends. The grading was fair but the overall experience felt routine."

Despite the stress, I feel significantly more prepared for graduate-level work."
104,18,11,2.7,medium,78,76,medium,"The course material was interesting and relevant, but the teaching style didn't quite match my learning preferences. I learn better through hands-on activities and visual demonstrations, while this course relied heavily on theoretical discussions and reading assignments. The professor was approachable and helpful during office hours, which made up for some of the classroom limitations. The midterm was challenging but fair, and the final project allowed for some creative expression."
105,21,9,2.4,easy,71,73,low,"Unfortunately, this course failed to engage me intellectually and felt more like a high school class than college-level education. The pace was extremely slow, and we spent too much time on basic concepts that could have been covered in a single session. The professor seemed hesitant to challenge students and often simplified complex topics to the point where they lost their meaning. I attended every class but felt like I wasn't learning anything new or developing critical thinking skills."
106,19,19,3.6,hard,93,91,high,"Absolutely phenomenal course that pushed every boundary of my academic comfort zone. The professor's expertise in both theoretical frameworks and practical applications created a unique learning environment that I've never experienced before.
