However, I found some of the reading materials to be quite dense and challenging to get through. The group projects were collaborative and fun, though coordination was sometimes difficult with different schedules. Overall, a solid learning experience that improved my understanding of the subject matter significantly."
2,19,8,2.8,easy,78,85,low,"This class was disappointingly easy and didn't challenge me intellectually. The lectures felt repetitive and the professor seemed to just read from slides without adding much value. I was hoping for more depth in the discussions and more rigorous assignments. The pace was too slow and I often found myself bored during class sessions. While I appreciate getting good grades, I don't feel like I learned as much as I could have."
3,21,22,3.8,hard,92,89,high,"Extremely challenging course that pushed me to my limits academically. The professor is brilliant but expects a lot from students. I spent countless hours studying and working on assignments, often staying up late to understand complex concepts. The workload was intense but manageable if you stay organized. Despite the difficulty, I feel incredibly accomplished and learned more than in any other class. The professor was always available during office hours for help."
4,18,12,3,medium,80,78,medium,"Good balance of theory and practical application. The professor used real-world examples that made abstract concepts easier to understand. I appreciated the variety in teaching methods - lectures, discussions, labs, and presentations. Some assignments were more engaging than others, and I wish there were more opportunities for creative projects. The feedback on assignments was constructive and helped me improve throughout the semester."
5,22,6,2.5,easy,72,70,low,"I struggled to stay motivated in this course due to lack of challenging content. The material seemed outdated and not relevant to current industry practices. Class attendance felt optional since everything was just repeated from the textbook. I would have preferred more interactive sessions and contemporary case studies. The professor was nice but didn't seem passionate about the subject matter, which affected the overall classroom energy."
6,20,18,3.5,hard,88,91,high,One of the most demanding but rewarding courses I've taken. The professor's expertise really showed through detailed explanations and thought-provoking questions. I had to completely change my study habits to keep up with the rigorous pace. The research project was particularly challenging but allowed me to dive deep into a topic I'm passionate about. My analytical skills improved dramatically throughout the semester.

My only complaint is that some classes ran over time frequently.
9,18,7,2.7,easy,74,72,low,This course felt like a waste of time honestly. The content was too basic and moved at a snail's pace. I already knew most of the material from high school or previous courses. The professor seemed unaware that students had different background knowledge levels. I ended up skipping many classes because I wasn't learning anything new. Definitely need more advanced sections for students ready for greater challenges.
