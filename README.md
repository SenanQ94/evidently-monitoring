# ðŸŽ“ ML Monitoring with Evidently AI

This project demonstrates how to implement a production-grade data and model monitoring pipeline using [Evidently](https://evidentlyai.com/) for a synthetic student performance dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- Simulates reference and current student data over time
- Runs full Evidently analysis:
  - Data summary
  - Data drift detection
  - Regression quality (actual vs predicted grades)
  - Text sentiment and keyword detection
- Outputs readable HTML monitoring reports
